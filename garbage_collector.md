**Garbage Collection in Java**

Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is a fundamental process of automatic memory management. It aims to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, thus preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory utilization within Java applications.

**Overview of Garbage Collection Process**

1. **Automatic Memory Management**: In Java, objects are dynamically allocated memory using the `new` operator. The memory allocated remains in use as long as there are references to the object.

2. **Identification of Unused Objects**: The Garbage Collector periodically identifies objects that are no longer reachable or referenced by any part of the program.

3. **Reclaiming Memory**: Once identified, the Garbage Collector deallocates the memory occupied by these unused objects, making it available for future allocations.

4. **Avoiding Memory Leaks**: Java's Garbage Collection mechanism helps prevent memory leaks by automatically managing memory deallocation. Unlike languages such as C, where manual memory deallocation using `free()` is necessary, Java handles this process implicitly.

**Benefits of Garbage Collection**

- **Automatic Management**: Developers are relieved from manually deallocating memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks and simplifying memory management.
  
- **Improved Stability**: Ensures programs run smoothly by preventing out-of-memory errors and crashes due to exhausted memory resources.

**Deleting Objects in Java**

In Java, objects are not explicitly deleted by the programmer. Instead, they become eligible for garbage collection when no longer referenced. Here are key considerations:

1. **Nullifying References**: To make an object eligible for Garbage Collection, assign `null` to its reference variable. For example:
   ```java
   MyClass obj = new MyClass();
   // Use obj
   obj = null; // Now obj is eligible for GC
   ```

2. **Primitive Types**: Primitive data types (int, float, boolean, etc.) do not involve garbage collection as they are not objects and do not hold references.

**Comparison with C Language**

- **Manual Memory Management**: In C, developers must explicitly manage memory allocation and deallocation using functions like `malloc()` and `free()`. This manual approach can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly.

- **Java's Approach**: Java's automatic Garbage Collection simplifies memory management by handling deallocation implicitly, ensuring efficient memory usage and reducing programming errors related to memory management.
